            <p>At the core, AU is a team of computer scientists who love music. Simple observations about the online music industry lead to a startling realization: most musical artists are unprepared to use the internet as a tool to advance their careers. By browsing SoundCloud, Spotify, or YouTube and it becomes shocking as to how much talent is left unheard. With AU, we are taking the opportunity to step away from the current paradigm by which radio and mainstream music are monopolized by a handful of labels; we move towards a new vision by which artists truly have a fighting chance to be successful independently.<br><br>We are dedicated to making sure every submission that comes our way is heard. We work with multiple clients to ensure organic engagement on various platforms including SoundCloud, Spotify, Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube.<br><br>WWe are committed to following every technological twist and turn of how music is promoted and spread on the internet, a task that requires constant awareness of the shifting dynamics of technologies underlying music-sharing platforms. With sensitivity to detail, we have distilled insights and used them to develop user-friendly plugins, tools, and other  applications.<br><br>We are here to remove the element of chance from becoming known. Working with us, it is no longer a matter of clinging to some hope that you will “blow up” and become viral, or even find substantive but intermittent success. Rather, with us, it is a function of pure promotion across our already well-established networks and gaining exposure to thousands of people who will stream your music through thousands of headphones across the world. We use tried-and-true tools that are essential to producing the highest-quality online presence possible.</p>

            <p>We believe in a world where artists are able to focus on making music while optimizing exposure to audiences everywhere. We are here to democratize the music industry.
